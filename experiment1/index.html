				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This generator is remixed from my professor's template. It is simply made by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
					Every time you click the "REROLL" button, it will randomly generate some different words. It is not a story or something, it is just some random shit for fun.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>We need to create an array that has a specific name with different words. Then It will based on a <strong>replacer()</strong> function to pick the random words.
					When the replacer() function catches any replaceable name, then it will randomly pick a word from that name array.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Before I actually did this assignment, I was scared about it because I saw a bunch of instructions. 
					For a non-native English speaker, reading English is very terrible. (at least for me, and my English is also poor, and reading needs more time). 
					However, when I actually doing the assignment, I found that it was quite simple.
					The hard part for me is to figure out what every file does. First of all, I was suck on the CSS files because I don't know what they are represents. 
					(I also think that every programmer gets annoyed by reading someone else's code.) 
					But after slowing down doing it, my mind becomes clearer and something else is simple to do.
