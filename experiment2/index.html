						<p>I am not good at using a camera, so many of the photos I took are different from what I saw, and they don't have the feeling I want, 
							so I take fewer and fewer photos. The reason I chose it is that I think it is my favorite, 
							the one that I feel the most, and the one that is closest to what I see with my naked eyes. 
							What I like most about this photo is the atmosphere and the lighting from the sun.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The waves and mountains in the picture are created using the vertex() function of p5js. <br>
					Sky gradient: Use the lerpColor() function to create a gradient color to simulate the sky at sunset. <br>
					The bird uses bezier() to draw a simple bird outline and move slowly over time. <br>
					Clouds and stones are simply replaced by circles and rectangles.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I started this assignment pretty late, so I didn't have much time to think about the code. 
					The examples in class helped me a lot, I think 50% ideas are from the examples. 
					When making the mountains, I originally just entered some numbers as the vertex values. 
					But then I found that when I changed the size of the canvas, the shape of the mountains would also change. 
					So I had to spend a lot of time looking for a more appropriate way to replace the vertex values. 
					In the end, I used the some values with width and height to replace those numbers. 
					Overall, my evaluation of this implementation is qualified because it has not yet reached what I wanted in my mind. 
					It does not achieve the hazy feeling of ink painting.
